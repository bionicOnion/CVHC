# CVHC: Computer Vision Handwriting Classifier

Produced as a research project for <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~furukawa/cse559a/2015_spring/">CSE 559A</a>
(Computer Vision) at Washington University in St. Louis.

Some code within the Learner directory is sourced from <a href="http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial">
this tutorial</a> on unsupervised feature learning and deep learning from Stanford University.

Requires OpenCV and MATLAB libraries to compile and run. The Makefile included in the Classifier directory has NOT been written generally and references the specific location of MATLAB and OpenCV on the computer used for development; to compile, modify the MATLAB_ROOT and OPENCV_ROOT variables to point to the correct locations on your computer.
